# algox

**algox** is a python package for *assisting users in selecting the most optimal algorithm* provided the dataset used must be completely preprocessed. It displays the performance metrics of numerous algorithms in each regression and classification problem and provides many other features to make the Model Selection process easy, effective and less time-consuming. The performance metrics output is displayed in the form of a table (pandas dataframe).

# Features

* Compares numerous algorithms' metrics. 
* Desired algorithms can be compared by specifying their names, if not, all the algorithms need to be compared. 
* Sort the output based on a metric in both ascending and descending order. 
* Download the output as a .csv file.
